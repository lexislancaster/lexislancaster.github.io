      <div class="text"><strong>Minimalism</strong> is the art of creating a website that is simple, pleasing, easy on the eye, and free of clutter. It should look clean, professional, yet catches people's attention. It is highly structured and follows strict rules. Things
        that should be considered in a <strong>minimalist</strong> website:</div>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Colours
        </li>
        <li>
          Fonts
        </li>

          Graphics

      <div class="text">Many believe that <strong>minimalism</strong> is the way to go. It is common in professional institutions as well as trendy websites. Some people live by the idea of <strong>minimalism</strong> and would die for the cause.</div>
    </p>


      <div class="text">For instance, there is even an organization that is trying to make cluttered websites illegal in Canada. They call themselves Alliance for <strong>Minimalist</strong> Websites or AMW for short. They consider themselves progressive and want to push
        for <strong>minimalist</strong> website standards. Some of their policies include:</div>


      <p>
        <div class="text">As you can tell, AMW takes themselves very seriously and wants to be respected by the public as a serious organization. They have had issues in the past with lack of respect and consideration. Often, they are ridiculed by critics of minimalism.
          The President for the Institution on Shutting Down <strong>Minimalism</strong> (ISDM) was very insistant on this,</div>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <div class="text">In conclusion, <strong>minimalism</strong> is not only a mode of design for the web developer. It is a lifestyle choice. Once you get into <strong>minimalism</strong>, there is no turning back.</div>
